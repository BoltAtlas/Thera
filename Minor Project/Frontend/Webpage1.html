            Have you ever felt a bit off, as if your day has been a bit hard on you? Have you been in a place where you
            might find things that you enjoy, not that likeable. Well if that has been the case with you, it's normal to
            have some bad days in our life, one could even say they are necessary for us to have bad days, so we can
            appreciate the good ones. But bad days don't have to stay bad and end bad. Introducing Thera, Thera is a
            Machine learning fueled bot that has one aim which is to work up a conversation with you to somehow lift
            your mood.

            Thera is a Therapeutic AI bot that works to improve the emotions of its user
            by engaging the user in conversations to lighten up their mood. Thera uses
            Machine learning algorithms, i.e. real-time learning based on user input and uses it
            to detect user's emotions using the text that the user provides and accordingly
            responds with the intent to change the user's attention away from the stress
            Similar to how a conversation with a therapist may go.
            <br>-<br>
            The main algorithm used to create Thera is Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short. It is an algorithm
            which gives computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.
            The data in the dataset used to train Thera went through 3 major steps before being used. Tokenization was
            done to break text into smaller units, common words were removed, and finally Lemmatization was perforemed
            to reduce words to their root form. All this was possible using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library
            in python.

            that is alone time and someone who is willing to listen to you. Thera makes it possible to
            talk about whatever you want to while not feeling like you are talking to a wall, it does
            that by actively replying and even working on betterment of the user's mood, Thera also keeps
            no logs of the users, so the principle of privacy is also never broken. Thera will however after
            every session, keeps record of the user's mood and time of session to act as feedback that users can
            use to understand themselves a lot better while comparing themselves to other users. This helps
            users to understand if their time was well spent and if their condition is normal, or they need
            more active treatment on their emotions
